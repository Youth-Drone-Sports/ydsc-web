# League Costs

## Equipment Suggestions

We suggest each Team purchase four (4) Gear Bundles that will stay with the Team. Pilots are welcome and encouraged to purchase their own Gear Bundles or comparable equipment when they are ready. This **one-time startup cost** helps keep costs down for new Pilots as they discover whether this sport is something they wish to continue to pursue.

Four is the number of Micro Quads that can realistically fly at the same time inside due to limitations with the video signals. Thus a team with four Gear Bundles has what it needs to scrimmage and maximize practice time.

### The Gear Bundle - $250 / Bundle

The YDSC Gear Bundle comes with everything needed to Race:
* Taranis QX7 Radio Transmitter w/ NiMH battery and charger
* FatShark Recon V3 Headset
* Team Blacksheep 1S LiPo Charger
* Protective Carrying Case

There are certainly cheaper transmitters and headsets and chargers available. However, this gear is ____


## Pilot Costs


### Racing - $100 / Pilot

We suggest that each Pilot be responsible for building and maintaining their own Micro Quad. The YDSC Spec Racer Kit comes with everything a Pilot needs to build their own, plus a few spare parts, batteries and a Hydra FPV Race Case. When a Pilot is responsible for their own quad, they typically fly it like they own it, which means less broken frames.


## Team Fees

Each Season will have an associated Team expense. The fee goes to cover:
* Team Kits
