### 3 STEPS TO STEM IN FLIGHT

#### STEP 1

Students grades 6-12 work with a teacher to start an after-school drone racing club, with a minimum of four (4) student pilots required to compete in team events. See our YDSC Rules & Requirements page for more details. *No prior drone experience is required or needed.* 

#### STEP 2

YDSC provides one (1) build-and-race drone kit per student (1:1 ratio) plus all necessary first-person view (FPV) equipment and assigns an expert local pilot mentor. See our Store page for pricing. 

#### STEP 3

YDSC schedules each team to compete in one (1) team race event per month from January-April 2020 including entry into the 2nd Annual Minnesota State Drone Sports Tournament (date in April-May TBD).

> "The entry point is ideal. Kids are given a chance to fail, and awesomeness requires practice."
